# Motion Capture System

By Shelby Ziccardi

Low-cost optical motion capture system for my undergraduate honors thesis in the Mathematical Sciences department at Lewis & Clark College.

- src folder holds my Microsoft Visual Studio project and the related files
- ffmpeg folder contains scripts to process video and its frames.

**THIS IS NOT A COMPLETED OR OPERATIONAL SYSTEM YET**

As this project nears completion, I will add instructions on how to use my system.
