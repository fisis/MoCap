# MoCap
I am building a low-cost optical motion capture system as my undergraduate honors thesis for the Mathematical Sciences department at Lewis & Clark College.

The src folder holds my Microsoft Visual Studio project and the related files while the ffmpeg folder contains scripts to process video and its frames.

As this project nears completion, I will add instructions on how to use my system.
